# How to Record (screens & video)

**Screens**
- Capture the full message and any routing/model tag (“Used GPT-5”).
- If possible, include the system clock (UTC).

**Video**
- Start from opening the app/page, show the clock.
- Record the entire flow: typing → response → routing/model label.
- Optionally refresh the page once to rule out edits.
- Save as MP4/MOV.

**Web**
- Save PDF/MHTML and take a Wayback snapshot.
- Include URL and capture time in metadata.
